            <p>In a windowless basement laboratory of the Lewis Integrative Science Building at the University of Oregon, Nik Zhelev’s lab is on a quest for the ultimate quiet. Not the absence of sound, but the absence of... everything. The basement lab of the research assistant professor and director of the Quantum Technology Master’s Internship Program is a prime location as the vibrations in the floors are lowest here, there are no windows supplying light, and temperatures are always most stable in these rooms due to the thermal damping of the surrounding concrete.</p>
            <p>In short, this is the perfect place to study the fragile, fleeting nature of quantum materials and qubits. Zhelev’s Quantum Technologies lab has become a sort of sanctuary from light and noise, an inner sanctum devoted to the study of the smallest particles of our world. Recently, Zhelev, students, and the Oregon Fabrication and Design (OFAD) completed a crucial component for the space: A final inner shield mounted at the very center of a cryostat in a nested structure like a set of Russian Matryoshka dolls. The shield was designed to create a progressively quieter and more stable environment—all the better for studying qubits, quantum particles that can exist in two states at once.</p>
            <p>But how we tell this story is, for now, in a state of superposition. The narrative is a haze of possibilities, waiting for you, the observer, to collapse it into a single reality. Your choice will determine the path we take.</p>

            <p>In the high-stakes quest of quantum computing, Zhelev's lab just acquired some epic-tier armor. This isn’t your standard vendor gear. Forged by the craftspeople of the OFAD instrumentation shop, this multi-layered, oxygen-free, high thermal conductivity copper shield provides a massive rebuff against environmental damage.</p>
            <p>In the world of quantum mechanics, the main boss isn’t a dragon; it’s decoherence. Stray photons and magnetic fields are like a constant damage-over-time (DoT) effect, corrupting the fragile quantum states, or qubits, that are the heart of the experiment. This new shield is a high-resistance cloak, designed to bring that DoT down to zero.</p>
            <p>The mission? To explore the strange physics inside a cryogenic dilution refrigerator, a machine that chills materials to less than 20 millikelvin (<20 mK)—a temperature colder than deep space. With their new gear equipped, the Zhelev team is ready to face the next level of quantum discovery.</p>

            <p>To plumb the universe for depths that reveal its most fundamental properties, you must first build a place of profound emptiness. In the basement of the Lewis Integrative Sciences Building, Zhelev’s lab recently finished constructing a man-made void, a sensory deprivation tank built to study quantum materials and qubits that may someday be part of a quantum computer</p>
            <p>The experiment itself lives inside a dilution refrigerator, an environment cooled to near absolute zero (<20 mK), where the frantic, cosmic dance of atoms is slowed to a near standstill. But even this cold is not enough. The universe is filled with an invisible, incessant chatter: stray photons, cosmic rays, the faint magnetic whispers of the building’s wiring. To a delicate qubit, held in a fragile superposition of states, this noise is a deafening roar that can shatter its quantum coherence in an instant</p>
            <p>The solution is a shield of profound isolation. Forged in the OFAD instrument shop from the purest oxygen-free copper, it is more than a piece of metal. It is the wall of a silent monastery, a place where a quantum state can exist, undisturbed, long enough for us to learn its secrets.</p>

            <h2>Research Section VI: A Call For Support</h2>
            <p>A new PhD student, still getting to know the campus's resources, stood at the workbench, looking on as the copper shield was assembled. "Wow, this custom piece for our experiment is perfect! It's so well-made and exactly what I needed. Sure is nice the UO research community has facilities like OFAD for custom work like this."</p>
            <p>An OFAD instrument machinist, with decades of experience at the university, smiled faintly. "You know, OFAD, or Oregon Fabrication and Design, has a rich history here. It actually evolved from what was known for decades as the Technical Science Administration, or TSA. We rebranded for obvious reasons. Probably should have done it sooner. It's been a core facility on campus for over 30 years, providing essential support to researchers across so many disciplines."</p>
            <p>He continued, "Back then, and still today, the mission was clear: to enable the real-world success of scientists, designers, and artists by giving them access to tools and expertise. Think of it as shortening the time it takes to go from a brilliant idea to a physical, working prototype. It's truly a unique and vital resource."</p>
            <p>"Unfortunately, even vital resources like OFAD aren't immune to the financial pressures facing the university. UO is currently grappling with a significant budget challenge, and we’re seeing changes to federal research funding with a push from the current administration to significantly cut funding for basic research. It's why protecting these unique resources is so important—they are the heart of what makes UO a leading research institution."</p>

            <h2>Where Old Meets New, or, 0s and 1s But Never 2s</h2>
            <p>A new PhD student, still getting to know the University of Oregon campus, stood at workbench, looking down on the custom copper shield before it was mounted onto the cryostat. “Wow, this is perfect! When we figured out that the cryostat’s off-the-shelf shielding wasn’t going to cut it for studying qubits at the temperature we needed, I was so relieved to learn that a place exists on campus to make a shield to spec like this.”</p>
            <p>Though some might regard the skills of an instrument machinist antiquated when surrounded by machinery aimed at decoding the secrets of quantum computing, our story of the copper shield is rather an example of human ingenuity and mixing the hands-on work of manufacturing with academic research.</p>
            <p>OFAD, one of the university’s core research facilities, began as a machine shop housing such tools as lathes and drill presses. But as technology has evolved, OFAD has also become host to the newest tools of the trade, including laser cutters, polymer and composite 3D printers, and CNC bed mills.</p>            
            <p>Standing beside the PhD student, an OFAD instrument machinist smiles at the admiration of his work. “Back when our shop was founded, and still today, the mission was clear: To enable the real-world success of scientists, designers, and artists by giving them access to tools and expertise. It’s my job to help people shorten the time it takes to go from a brilliant idea to a physical, working prototype. It's truly a unique and vital resource.”</p>            
            <p>"Unfortunately, even vital resources like OFAD aren’t immune to the financial pressures facing the university. The UO is currently grappling with a significant budget challenge, and we’re seeing changes to federal research funding that threaten to significantly cut funding for “basic research”—fundamental research that establishes understanding of a previously unexplained phenomena or helps create a theory about how something works. In other words, exactly the kind of research that OFAD enables. That’s why protecting these unique resources is so important—they are the heart of what makes UO a leading research institution helping to solve society’s most pressing problems. Making the monumental leap from our current computing capabilities—in which units of data are confined to 0s and 1s, yes or no, on or off—to those of quantum computing—where those units of data, qubits, exist in superposition, which is a state anywhere between 0 and 1 and undefined until measured—promises to enable a new era of computing power many times faster than what’s now possible.</p>

            <h2>The Flex</h2>
            <p>An instrument machinist from the OFAD shop, a person who has spent endless days working in the confines of tolerances along the lines of of thousandths of an inch, removed the bifocals he was wearing to tap tiny metric holes around the edge of a copper flange. He had spent the day carefully assembling the nested layers of an annealed copper shield.</p>
            <p>A new PhD student, barely old enough to remember a world without smartphones, stared at the finished product. The polished surface gleamed in the natural light streaming through the windows of the machine shop.</p>
            <p>“This might be the last time this thing sees any photons born from Sol,” the machinist mumbled, mostly to himself. “From now on it’s just regurgitated light from sterile LEDs down in Nik’s Lab.”</p>
            <p>“Nice flex!” the student said, nodding with approval.</p>
            <p>The machinist paused, a bemused look on his face. He ran a hand over the smooth, cold metal. “Flex? It shouldn’t have that much anymore. “The cylindrical shape we formed it into provides structural rigidity.” </p>
            <p>His brow furrowed. “This is oxygen-free high-conductivity copper. It’s annealed to be soft, sure, which made forming it easier and doesn’t hurt for better thermal contact, but once it’s bolted down at 20 millikelvin, it’s not going to be flexing anywhere.”</p>
            <p>The student blinked, a slow smile spreading across their face. “Right. No, I mean... it’s a flex. What you said about photons. Like, showing off. It’s just... really, really cool.”</p>
            <p>The machinist stared at the shield, then back at the student, a flicker of understanding in his eyes. He gave a wry exhale, with the slightest back and forth shake of his head. “Well, I suppose we are showing off a little. What say we bag everything up to keep it clean and bring it to its new home now? Say goodbye to the sun, buddy.”</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Tightrope</h2>
            <p>Imagine a spinning coin. Before it lands, it's not truly heads and it's not truly tails—it's in a fuzzy, probabilistic combination of both. This is the essence of <strong>superposition</strong>. A qubit, the fundamental unit of quantum information, can be a 0, a 1, or both at the same time, holding vastly more information than a classical bit.</p>
            <p>This powerful state, however, is incredibly fragile. The slightest interaction with the outside world—a single stray photon, a tiny vibration, a fluctuation in a magnetic field—can "observe" the qubit and force it to choose a state. The coin lands. The superposition is lost, and the quantum information "decoheres" into a boring, classical 0 or 1. This collapse is called <strong>decoherence</strong>.</p>
            <p>The shield built for Professor Zhelev's lab is an act of extreme preservation. By blocking out all external noise, it allows the qubits to remain on their quantum tightrope, in a state of pure superposition, for as long as possible, giving scientists a precious window to perform their experiments.</p>
